# Description
1. The [netology](/netology) folder contains my diploma project from an SQL educational course. In this project, I created a PostgreSQL database using **Docker** - just run docker-compose - upload there dump of demo-db, connected to the database inside the container via **psycopg2**, and replicated all the exercises in a **jupyter notebook**.<br>
Additionally, I explored the differences between writing standalone SQL scripts and querying data from the database to perform exercises using **pandas** lib from **python**. 

2. The [stepik](/stepik) folder contains my replication of a well-structured and popular SQL training program from **stepik.com**. Please note that all exercise texts are in Russian. The required databases for the exercises are integrated into the same containerized Postgres instance as described earlier.
