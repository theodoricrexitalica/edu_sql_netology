# Description
The [netology sql](/netology) folder contains my diploma project from an SQL educational course. In this project, I created a PostgreSQL database using **Docker**, upload there dump of demo-db, connected to the database inside the container via **psycopg2**, and replicated all the exercises in a **jupyter notebook**.

The [stepik sql](/stepik) folder holds my replication of a popular and well-structured SQL training program from **stepik.com**.
